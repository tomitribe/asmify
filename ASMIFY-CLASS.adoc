## SYNOPSIS
asmify class  _File_

## DESCRIPTION
Read the specified File as a class and output the ASM code required to create that class via ASM.

The  output of the command is Java code that uses the ASM APIs to build a class definition that would be identical to the class file specified.
This allows for a text-searchable representation of the bytecode, which can be very useful for analyzing the impact of bytecode  transformation
tools.

All output is written to the console

## IMPORTANT
This command is not a decompiler.

It  should  be  noted  that not all bytecode can be translated to Java syntax.  This includes bytecode created by the Groovy, Scala, Kotlin and
similar compilers.  Similarly, one Java source file can result in several class files.  It is not the goal of this tool to attempt to erase  or
hide the class files.

## EXAMPLE
To view the asmified output of a class file in the target directory of a Maven build

    asmify class target/classes/org/example/colors/Orange.class

## RELATED
To process an entire zip file

    asmify zip target/myapp.war /tmp/foo
