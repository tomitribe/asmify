## SYNOPSIS
asmify zip  _File_ _Directory_

## DESCRIPTION
Read the specified zip archive and output all contents to the specified directory.

The  contents  of  the zip will be extracted into a new folder in the output directory.  The new folder will be named after the zip file, which
means it is possible to asmify several zip files into the same directory.  It also means there is no need to manually create a directory  named
after the zip -- this tool will create that for you.

As the tool iterates over the zip file, each zip entry will be handled as follows:

- *class entries*: contents of the class file will be parsed into asmified format and written to the output directory with a ".asm"
       extension. It is safe to view these files in an IDE as Java files and associate the ".asm" extension in your IDE accordingly.

- *file entries*: entries that are unknown will be extracted as-is into the output directory.

- *nested zip entries*: entries with a well-known zip extension (zip, jar, war, ear, rar) will be recursively extracted into the output
       directory using the above logic.

## PARAMETERS
 - _File_: The path to a zip, jar, war, ear or similar file to parse and output as ASM.

 - _Directory_: The directory where all files will be extracted and converted to ASM.

## IMPORTANT
This command is not a decompiler.

It  should  be  noted  that not all bytecode can be translated to Java syntax.  This includes bytecode created by the Groovy, Scala, Kotlin and
similar compilers.  Similarly, one Java source file can result in several class files.  It is not the goal of this tool to attempt to erase  or
hide the class files.

## EXAMPLE
To view the asmified output of a zip file and output that into a directory in /tmp/

    mkdir /tmp/foo
    asmify zip target/myapp.war /tmp/foo

The  above  would  result  in  a new directory called /tmp/foo/myapp.war containing the extracted and asmified contents of target/myapp.war

## RELATED
To output an individual class file

    asmify class target/classes/org/example/colors/Orange.class
